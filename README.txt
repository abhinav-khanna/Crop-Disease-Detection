“Crop Disease Detection" application will help the farmers to detect the diseases at an early stage and provide them proper suggestions and remedies 
,which are widely acceptable by world class experts. Farmers will be able to use pesticides and fertilizers at the right time and right amount , 
so that the crops will not be harmed much and fertility of the soil remain preserved. All they need to do is “ click a picture of the leaf and area
of the farm” and our system will tell them the disease with which the crop is infected and which fertilisers and pesticides to use to overcome that
disease as well as preventions they need to consider next time .
